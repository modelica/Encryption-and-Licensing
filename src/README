Building instructions
=====================


Prererequisites:
----------------
 * For Windows:
  * CMake 2.8 or better
  * Perl, e.g. from http://strawberryperl.com/
  * Nasm, from http://nasm.sourceforge.net/
  * Visual Studio (or MinGW)
  * Miniz ziplibrary (https://code.google.com/p/miniz/)
  
 * For Linux:
  * CMake 2.8 or better
  * Perl
  * Normal compilation tools, e.g. GCC
  * Miniz ziplibrary (https://code.google.com/p/miniz/)

* Before executing test_tool, make sure that the libpath variable in test_tool.c points to 
  a valid folder. 
  
* After linking you can get a warning saying: "C:/Program Files/Windows Kits/.../mt.exe : Failed to   
  write to updated manifest to the resource of file test_tool.exe"
  
  If you compile again this warning has usually gone away. I think it has something to do with Visual Studio
  but I am not quite sure. It doesn't affect the application though.
  
* If you get an error saying "Error: SSL: Failed to create client CTX structure." when you run test_tool.exe this means
  that the size of the tools private key (in its c-file) is different from the extern statement in source file (mlle_licensing.c).

Building on Windows with Visual Studio:
---------------------------------------
 1. Start a MSVC compilation shell for the target platform (32 or 64-bit).

 2. Add CMake, Perl and NAMS binary directories to PATH.
 
 3. Create a build directory and cd to it.

 4. Execute the commands:
 
   $ cmake <source directory> \
           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<target directory> \
           -DDECRYPTOR=<choice of decryptor> \
           -DLICENSE_MANAGER=<choice of license manager> \
           -DOBFUSCATOR=<choice of obfuscator module> \
           -G"NMake Makefiles"
   $ cmake --build .
   $ cmake --build . --target install
   
   Note 1: LICENSE_MANAGER and OBFUSCATOR have dummy default implementations if not set.
   Note 2: It is necessary to use the NMake generator due to unknown problems building openssl with other generators.
   Note 3: If there are ssl-keys in the openssl_keys directory these will be used. Otherwise new ones will be created.
    
 5. To test the tool library type "test_tool.exe".
     
  Note: You must change the part in the test tool that fetch files from LVE.
        If you want to fetch an encrypted file, that file must be encrypted with the
        latest "encrypt_file.exe" that uses the same random key as LVE to encrypt/decrypt files.


Building on Linux:
------------------
 1. Create a build directory and cd to it.
  
 2. Execute the commands:
 
   $ cmake <source directory> \
           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<target directory> \
           -DDECRYPTOR=<choice of decryptor> \
           -DLICENSE_MANAGER=<choice of license manager> \
           -DOBFUSCATOR=<choice of obfuscator module>
   $ cmake --build .
   $ cmake --build . --target install
  
   Note: If there are ssl-keys in the openssl_keys directory these will be used. Otherwise new ones will be created.
  
   
 3. To test the tool library type "./test_tool.exe".
 
 Note 1: DECRYPTOR and LICENSE_MANAGER have dummy default values if not set.
 Note 2: You must change the part in the test tool that fetch files from LVE.
         If you want to fetch an encrypted file, that file must be encrypted with the
         latest "encrypt_file.exe" that uses the same random key as LVE to encrypt/decrypt files.
